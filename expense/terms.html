            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Last Updated: Dec 22, 2017</p>
            <p>Thank you for using InvoiceBot. InvoiceBot is operated by meisterwork GmbH, a cooperation based in Austria. These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) and our Privacy Policy govern your use of all available InvoiceBot Services and Apps (“InvoiceBot”), so please read them carefully before using InvoiceBot.</p>
            <p>By using InvoiceBot, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to these Terms, do not use InvoiceBot. If you are using InvoiceBot on behalf of an organization (such as your employer), you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization, and are indicating that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that organization.</p>
            <p>We may revise the Terms from time to time. Changes may be posted to our blog and within our Apps, so please check that regularly. The most current version will always be posted on our Terms page. By continuing to use InvoiceBot after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, please stop using InvoiceBot.</p>
            <h2>Auto Renewing Subscriptions</h2>
            For auto renewing subscriptions completed in our iOS Apps following terms apply:
            <p>
                - Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.<br>
                - Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.<br>
                - Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.<br>
                - Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.<br>
                - Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.<br>
                - You can cancel a free trial or subscription anytime by turning off auto-renewal through your iTunes account settings. This must be done 24 hours before the end of a free trial or subscription period to avoid being charged. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the free service.
